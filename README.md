# Deep Learning KC

This repository contains a Python file with the code to get image captioning. The Python library that we are using is Keras and TensorFlow. 
The programming language that we use is Python.

This repository has the following files:
  1. pictures/
  2. Practica_Deep_Learning.docx
  3. Deep_Learning_KC.ipynb
  4. README.md
 
I worked in Google Colaboratory because you need GPUs to process the images.

## 1. pictures/

The file pictures/ contains all pictures that we are using the example in image captioning.

In pictures/ we have the pictures:
  1. 11293289843_831b538448_o.jpg
  2. example.jpg
  3. example_reducida.jpg


## 2. Practica_Deep_Learning.docx

This file contains the objective of the practice of Image captioning


## 3. Deep_Learning_KC.ipynb

This Python file contains the Python code to get Image captioning.

We are going some experiments with different kind of: CNN networks and RNN networks.
We are using the following networks:
* CNN:
  1. VGG
  2. ResNet

* RNN:
  1. LSTM
  2. GRU
